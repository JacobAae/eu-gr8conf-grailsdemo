= Grails 3.0.1 Demo for Beginners Workshop

== Tasks

This is where the specified tasks fr the workshop ends, and you will have to do the continued work on your own!

What you could start with are

* Clean up the remaining controllers from transactional stuff -> services
* Fix the issues you have encountered with the default views (displaying collections/relations)
* Study `views/layouts/main.gsp` and change the top bar on all pages
* Study the datasource section in `conf/application.yml` and make the data persistent over restarts

== Hints and pointers

* The slides for the workshop
* http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/3.0.1/guide/

== Next step

When you are done, you have completed this very brief Grails Introduction - and will be a better man :)
